# Carbon Footprint Tracker

## Overview
The **Carbon Footprint Tracker** is a browser extension designed to help users monitor the carbon footprint generated by their browsing activities. By tracking the amount of data transferred during web requests, the extension calculates the associated carbon emissions and provides real-time feedback on both session and total carbon footprints. This project is ideal for environmentally conscious users who want to understand and reduce their digital carbon footprint.

---

## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitors data transferred during web requests and calculates the associated carbon emissions.
- **Session Footprint**: Displays the carbon footprint for the current browsing session.
- **Total Footprint**: Tracks the cumulative carbon footprint over time.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset the total carbon footprint history.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean and intuitive popup interface to view carbon footprint data.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the popup interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the popup and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling real-time data tracking, calculations, and communication between the background script and popup.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: For intercepting web requests, managing storage, and handling extension functionality.

---

## File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **`manifest.json`**: The manifest file defining the extension's metadata, permissions, and structure.
- **`background.js`**: The background script responsible for intercepting web requests, calculating carbon emissions, and managing storage.
- **`popup/popup.html`**: The HTML file for the popup interface.
- **`popup/popup.js`**: The JavaScript file handling popup functionality and communication with the background script.
- **`popup/popup.css`**: The stylesheet for styling the popup interface.
- **`icons/`**: Contains icons for the extension in various sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128).

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Tracking**:
   - The extension uses the `chrome.webRequest.onHeadersReceived` API to intercept HTTP responses and extract the `content-length` header, which indicates the size of the data transferred.
   - The data size is converted into kilobytes (KB) and multiplied by a carbon intensity factor to estimate the carbon emissions.

2. **Carbon Footprint Calculation**:
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Carbon Footprint (gCO2)} = \left(\frac{\text{Data Transferred (bytes)}}{1024}\right) \times \text{Carbon Intensity Factor}
     \]
   - The default carbon intensity factor is set to **0.5 gCO2 per KB**.

3. **Storage and Updates**:
   - The extension stores the total carbon footprint in `chrome.storage.local` and updates it with each new calculation.
   - Real-time updates are sent to the popup using the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` API.

4. **Popup Interface**:
   - The popup displays the session and total carbon footprints.
   - A reset button allows users to clear the total carbon footprint history.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The extension will now be available in your browser.

---

## Usage
1. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
2. View the **Session Carbon Footprint** and **Total Carbon Footprint** in grams of CO2.
3. Use the **Reset History** button to clear the total carbon footprint data.

## Customization
- **Carbon Intensity Factor**: Adjust the `carbonIntensity` variable in `background.js` to reflect your region's carbon intensity.
- **Icons**: Replace the icons in the `icons/` folder with your own designs.
- **Styling**: Modify `popup.css` to customize the appearance of the popup.

---

## APIs Used
- **Chrome Web Request API**: For intercepting and analyzing web requests.
- **Chrome Storage API**: For storing and retrieving the total carbon footprint data.
- **Chrome Runtime API**: For communication between the background script and popup.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Regional Carbon Intensity**: Allow users to select their region for more accurate carbon footprint calculations.
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Provide a breakdown of carbon emissions by website or domain.
- **Historical Data**: Add a feature to view carbon footprint trends over time.
- **Export Data**: Enable users to export their carbon footprint data for analysis.

## Conclusion
The **Carbon Footprint Tracker** is a simple yet powerful tool for understanding the environmental impact of your online activities. By providing real-time feedback and actionable insights, it empowers users to make more sustainable choices while browsing the web. Feel free to explore, modify, and expand the project to suit your needs!
